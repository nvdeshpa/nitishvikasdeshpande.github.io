# About Me
* I'm Nitish Vikas Deshpande, third year Ph.D. student in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ece.ucsd.edu/) at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/).
* I am working as a graduate student researcher at UC San Diego under the supervision of Prof. Robert W. Heath Jr. I transferred my Ph.D. from [NC State ECE](https://ece.ncsu.edu/) to [UCSD ECE](https://ucsd.edu/) in Jan 2024 after getting a Master of Science degree from NC State.
* I graduated from [Electrical Engineering](https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/),  [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India](http://iitk.ac.in/) in May 2021.
* My research interest is analyzing and designing wireless communication systems, focusing on wideband and large-array MIMO systems. I apply a physically consistent circuit theory approach to model communication systems, bridging the gap between EM theory and information theory.
* I completed two summer internships at the Radio Systems Research Group of Nokia Bell Labs. For the summer 2023 internship at Nokia Bell Labs, I received the "Outstanding student research" award.
