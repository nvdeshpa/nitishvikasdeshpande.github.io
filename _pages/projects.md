<b> Improving MIMO communication with advances from circuits and antennas </b> 
<br>
<br> 
MIMO communication theory has advanced separately from progress in circuits and antennas. The increasing scale of antennas and bandwidth, though, now requires developing a physically consistent communication theory. Such a theory should better incorporate RF hardware and allow more accurate prediction of communication data rates and making energy efficiency tradeoffs. My research focuses on bridging the gap between conventional communication theory and antennas/EM/circuit theory.
