<b> Achievable rate analysis under Bode-Fano wideband matching constraints</b> 
<br>
<br>
Proposed a general bound on the MISO achievable rate over all linear and passive matching networks
<br>
Developed a practical approach to approximate the achievable rate bound using ADS circuit design software
