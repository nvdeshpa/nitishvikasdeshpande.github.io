<b> [Mechanism Design for Heterogenous Differentially Private Data Acquistion](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gjpscdcVE1ZGr-4La6Zbt3UbuOSweC4EQXrMvw0oy94/edit?usp=sharing)</b> 
Developed a payment mechanism to incentivize privacy-sensitive users to share their data for ML tasks while satisfying their heterogeneous differential privacy constraints

<b> [Compressive Sensing Matrix Design](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Eght44a12nbU_SFre9YcH2sVNxhyWKRb/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110561627402890189556&rtpof=true&sd=true)</b>
Designed sensing matrices by minimizing weighted triple coherence (determined from training data). Also, proposed an approach to design weights to handle the rotation and scaling of images
